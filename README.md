# 💡 Ultrasonic Motion Activated Light & Distance Estimator 
Ultrasonic motion-activated light & distance estimator built with Arduino Nano — a compact, smart system that automatically turns on a light when motion is detected, 
while simultaneously estimating the distance of the object on the serial monitor using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor.

## ⚙️ What It Does

- Detects motion using an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
- Activates an LED or light when someone approaches
- Calculates real-time distance to the object in centimetres.

## 🎯 Features

- Motion-triggered lighting
- Real-time distance display (can be seen on the Arduino serial monitor)
- Portable and beginner-friendly
- Great for smart desks, stairways, closets, or hallway automation

## 💬 Why I Built This

I love automating the tiny things that make life smoother.  
This system is my take on motion-sensing activated light, and not only that— it also tells you how far the object detected is.
