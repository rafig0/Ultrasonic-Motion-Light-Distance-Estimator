# 💡 Ultrasonic Motion Activated Light & Distance Estimator 
Relay-free ultrasonic motion-activated light & distance estimator built with Arduino
A compact, smart system that turns on a light based on detected motion while estimating the distance of the approaching object using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor — no relay modules involved.

## ⚙️ What It Does

- Detects motion using an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
- Activates an LED or light when someone approaches
- Calculates real-time distance to the object
- Entirely relay-free — simple and efficient

## 🎯 Features

- Motion-triggered lighting
- Real-time distance display (optional via serial monitor or LEDs)
- Portable and beginner-friendly
- Great for smart desks, stairways, closets, or hallway automation

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Arduino Nano / Uno  
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor  
- LED or external light  
- Jumper wires, breadboard (or PCB)

## 💬 Why I Built This

I love automating the tiny things that make life smoother.  
This system is my take on motion-sensing lighting without relays — just precise ultrasonic sensing and a simple Arduino setup.
